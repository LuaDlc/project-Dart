<h6>Whem statarted, the program should this prompt:<h6>
->Rock, paper or scissors? (r/p/s)
It should then read the user input and use it as follows.
- If the user enters "r, "p" or "s", threat this as a valid move. 
Else, if the user enters "q", quit the program.
-If the user enters anything else, show "Invalid input", and prompt again.

<h6>After the user has entered a valid command,
generate a motion
that compares the machine's movement with
the user's movement,
show the moves and display the information:
"you won",
"you lost" or "tie". The whole game within
a loop<h6>

(break: d√° fim √° repeti√ß√£o)

stdtin
The standard input stream of data read by this program.
Stdin get stdin {
  return IOOverrides.current?.stdin ?? _stdin;
}

 Random
external factory Random([int? seed]);

  Creates a cryptographically secure random number generator
  If the program cannot provide a cryptographically secure
  source of random numbers, it throws an [UnsupportedError].
